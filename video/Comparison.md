Comparison table of context window vs, RAG vs Pensieve

| Feature/Aspect               | Context Window LLMs                          | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)         | Pensieve                                      |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Memory Usage                  | Limited to context window                    | Utilizes external memory                     | Efficient memory management                   |
| Retrieval Mechanism           | None                                         | Retrieves relevant documents                 | Retrieves and summarizes relevant memories    |
| Response Generation           | Generates responses based on context        | Generates responses based on retrieved docs  | Generates responses based on summarized memories |
| Use Cases                     | General conversation                         | Document-based Q&A                           | Memory-augmented conversation                 |
| Performance                   | Fast, but limited context                    | Slower due to retrieval step                 | Optimized for speed and relevance             |
| Latency                       | Low                                          | Higher due to retrieval                      | Low                                           |
| Cost                          | Lower (no external storage)                  | Higher (due to storage and retrieval costs)  | Moderate (efficient use of memory)            |
| Retention                     | No                                           | Limited                                      | Yes                                           |
