Pensieve – 2 Minute Hackathon Demo Script

TOTAL TARGET: ~2:00 (≈285 words)

0:00 – 0:10  COLD OPEN / PROBLEM HOOK
VISUAL: Split screen – user asks different LLM/chat apps the same personal scheduling question. Each gives an incomplete answer.
NARRATOR (energized): "Ever notice how every AI agent you use forgets who you are the moment you close the tab? Your context is scattered and vendor locked."

0:10 – 0:25  PROBLEM STATEMENT
VISUAL: Logos (ChatGPT, Teams, Slack, Email, OneNote, OneDrive, Notion) floating in isolated bubbles.
NARRATOR: "Today’s LLM agents don’t actually know you — they only peek at the narrow slice of data you surrender to that platform. Your memory is fragmented and none of it is truly yours."

0:25 – 0:40  INTRODUCING PENSIEVE
VISUAL: Bubbles converge into one secure personal vault icon labeled Pensieve.
NARRATOR: "Meet Pensieve. Your portable, user‑owned memory layer for AI. Pensieve unifies your interactions and knowledge across platforms, so any agent you authorize can finally act with real context — your context."

0:40 – 1:05  HOW IT BUILDS MEMORY
VISUAL: Browser extension capturing (a) ChatGPT thread summary, (b) Teams message decision, (c) Slack action. Background services pulling metadata from email, OneNote, OneDrive, Notion.
NARRATOR: "In the foreground, the browser extension observes approved moments — conversations, decisions, tasks — turning them into structured ‘memories.’ In the background, connected data sources enrich that graph: commitments from emails, documents you referenced, meeting notes you wrote. Each memory flows through two layers: (1) Cosmos DB vector index for fast semantic recall — 'find similar intents, tasks, people'; (2) Graphiti + Neo4j knowledge graph extracting entities, relationships, timelines — 'how does this relate across projects and people?' Raw text + facets → embedding (Cosmos) → entities & links (Graphiti). All normalized, timestamped, and permission scoped."

1:05 – 1:20  MAINTENANCE & CONTROL
VISUAL: Memory lifecycle diagram (Capture → Normalize → Embed → Index → Retention Rules). User toggling sources.
NARRATOR: "Lifecycle automation keeps quality high: deduping, enrichment, retention policies. You can pause or revoke any source — ingestion stops instantly. Delete a memory? It’s purged from both the vector index and the graph, not just hidden. And you own every layer: raw, embeddings, relationships."

1:20 – 1:35  WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT
VISUAL: Side-by-side: ‘Traditional: Platform-Locked, Ephemeral, Opaque’ vs ‘Pensieve: Portable, Persistent, Transparent.’
NARRATOR: "Unlike traditional agent plugins that hoard context, Pensieve is an interoperability layer — portable, privacy‑first, and agent‑agnostic."

1:35 – 1:50  MAGIC MOMENT
VISUAL: In Microsoft Teams, user types: “/assist Summarize all open commitments about Project Atlas.” Pensieve panel responds with cross‑source synthesized summary plus source citations.
NARRATOR: "Ask any connected agent a question, and it draws from a unified, permissioned memory graph — citing exactly where insights came from."

1:50 – 2:00  DASHBOARD & CALL TO ACTION
VISUAL: Dashboard: Source toggles, searchable memories list with edit/delete, timeline heatmap.
NARRATOR: "From the dashboard you choose sources, inspect, edit, or delete memories — total transparency. This is context you truly own. Join us and help build agent intelligence that belongs to the user: Pensieve."
