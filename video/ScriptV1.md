1. Ever notice how every AI agent forgets who you are the moment you close the tab? Your context is scattered and vendor‑locked.
2. Today’s LLM agents don’t actually know you—they only peek at the narrow slice of data you surrender to that platform. Your memory is fragmented, and none of it is truly yours.
3. Meet Pensieve: your portable, user‑owned memory layer for AI. It unifies your interactions and knowledge across platforms so any agent you authorize can finally act with real context—your context.
4. In the foreground, the browser extension observes approved moments, turning them into structured memories. In the background, connected data sources periodically enrich the knowledge graph.
5. Semantic and contextual memories are stored in the Azure Cosmos DB vector databasase for fast recall. As new context appears, existing memories can be updated, deleted, or added to the vector index.
6. Episodic and procedural memories are captured in a knowledge graph maintained using Graphiti and Neo4j. Nodes are entities; edges are relationships. As new information arrives, the graph is updated incrementally, adding, updating or invalidating nodes and edges to reflect the latest state.
7. When needed, relevant memories are retrieved using vector search and nearest‑neighbor techniques to surface prior context.
8. This approach offers several advantages compared to traditional methods. Retrieval is faster, cost is lower, and recall is higher.
9. All of this happens with complete user ownership and control. In the dashboard, you can toggle or revoke any source; ingestion stops instantly. You can also view, edit, or delete memories. Delete one and it’s truly gone—purged from the vector index and the graph, not just hidden.
10. Over time, platforms won’t need their own siloed memory—they’ll just plug into yours.
11. Pensieve: Unified Memory. Truly Yours.
