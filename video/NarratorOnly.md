"Ever notice how every AI agent you use forgets who you are the moment you close the tab? Your context is scattered — locked inside vendors' silos: chat logs here, emails there, notes everywhere — and none of it is truly yours."
"Today’s LLM agents don’t actually know you — they only peek at the narrow slice of data you surrender to that platform. Your memory is fragmented. Your intelligence is vendor‑locked."
"Meet Pensieve. Your portable, user‑owned memory layer for AI. Pensieve unifies your interactions and knowledge across platforms, so any agent you authorize can finally act with real context — your context."
"In the foreground, the browser extension observes approved moments — conversations, decisions, tasks — turning them into structured ‘memories.’ In the background, connected data sources enrich that graph: commitments from emails, documents you referenced, meeting notes you wrote. Each memory flows through two layers: (1) Cosmos DB vector index for fast semantic recall — 'find similar intents, tasks, people'; (2) Graphiti + Neo4j knowledge graph extracting entities, relationships, timelines — 'how does this relate across projects and people?' Raw text + facets → embedding (Cosmos) → entities & links (Graphiti). All normalized, timestamped, and permission scoped."
"Lifecycle automation keeps quality high: deduping, enrichment, retention policies. You can pause or revoke any source — ingestion stops instantly. Delete a memory? It’s purged from both the vector index and the graph, not just hidden. And you own every layer: raw, embeddings, relationships."
"Unlike traditional agent plugins that hoard context, Pensieve is an interoperability layer — portable, privacy‑first, and agent‑agnostic."
"Ask any connected agent a question, and it draws from a unified, permissioned memory graph — citing exactly where insights came from."
"From the dashboard you choose sources, inspect, edit, or delete memories — total transparency. This is context you truly own. Join us and help build agent intelligence that belongs to the user: Pensieve."
